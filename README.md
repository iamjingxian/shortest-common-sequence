#### shortest-common-sequence
shortest common sequence via 2-step approach
* step 1: Compute the length of the SCS;
* step 2: Infer an SCS from the computation in Step 1.

this code outputs the shortest common supersequence (SCS) for two strings that are read from an input file named as “Two_strings.txt” in which each string is given in a line, where each string contains at most 500 English letters.

While there may be multiple SCSs for two strings, this code outputs one such SCS.
